			<h2>About Epoch</h2>

			<p>Epoch is the official design system of Happening. The word ‘epoch’ connotes a special period of time marked by distinctive features, events, and/or memories. With an event-production company like Happening, it’s important to combine both creative & organizational skills in a perfect balance, coordinating of all elements of a given event--customer needs, supplier relationships, creative & aesthetic vision, and everything in between. Our aim is for Epoch Design System to provide that same balance through a library of working code and design guidelines, in order to create a meaningful & memorable experience for both staff and valued customers.</p>
